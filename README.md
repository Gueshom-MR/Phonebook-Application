Project Overview The Mobile Phonebook Application is designed to manage and manipulate contact information for a telecommunications company. The application provides basic phonebook functionalities using simple linear data structures, specifically arrays, to store and manage contacts.

The key operations supported by this application are:

Insert Contact: Add new contacts with a name and phone number.
Search Contact: Retrieve contact details by searching for a name. 
Display All Contacts: View a list of all stored contacts. 
Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the phonebook by name. 
Update Contact: Modify existing contact details. 
Sort Contacts: Alphabetically sort contacts by name to improve search efficiency (optional).
Efficiency Analysis: An analysis of the search algorithm's efficiency (linear search with O(n) complexity).

The application is built with simplicity in mind, focusing on fundamental operations and ease of implementation. The choice of arrays allows for straightforward manipulation of contacts.
